# Problem Set 2 

Stereo Window 

1. Window based approaches are used for the purpose of Stereo correspondence.
2. Implementation was done using SSD and normalized correlation
3. Disparity image and 3D depth plot is computed and displayed

# Problem Set 3

Geometry

1. Calibration of camera's 3D coordinates
2. Relationship between the two views of the camera is established.


# Problem Set 4

Harris SIFT and RANSAC

1. Computation of Harris Corners
2. key points used to implement SIFT. RANSAC used to find the best matches using similarity algorithm.


# Problem Set 6

Particle Filter

1. Predict where the object would be in the enxt frame
2. Particle filter, which would predict by sampling particles based on their probability
